YEAH
UHHUH YEAH PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING IN IN MY FAMILY UH MY GRANDMOTHER SHE HAD TO BE PUT IN NURSING HOME AND UM SHE HAD USED A WALKER FOR FOR QUITE SOMETIME PROBABLY ABOUT SIX TO NINE MONTHS AND UM
SHE HAD A FALL AND UH FINALLY UH SHE HAD UH PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND IT GOT SO MUCH THAT SHE COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF HER HOUSE SHE THEN SHE LIVED IN AN APARTMENT AND UM
THAT WAS EVEN HARDER ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST A CHANGE OF
CHANGE OF LOCATION AND IT WAS VERY DISTURBING FOR HER BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SO USED TO TRAVELING I MEAN SHE TRAVELED SHE HAD SHE HAD CHILDREN ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND YOU KNOW SHE SPENT NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR JUST VISITING HER CHILDREN
AND UM THAT WAS PRETTY HEARTRENDING FOR HER I THINK WHEN SHE FINALLY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT YOU KNOW NO I CANNOT I CANNOT TAKE CARE OF MYSELF
YEAH I MEAN FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS YOU KNOW FOR MOST OF THEIR LIFE HAS HAS UH
NOT JUST MERELY HAD A FARM BUT HAD TEN CHILDREN HAD A FARM RAN EVERYTHING BECAUSE HER HUSBAND WAS AWAY IN THE COAL MINES AND YOU KNOW FACING THAT SITUATION IT'S IT'S QUITE A DILEMMA I THINK
YEAH WELL MY UH MY UH PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST DECISIONS I THINK THAT WAS VERY STRENGTHENED FOR OUR FAMILY WAS RATHER THAN HAVE ONE CHILD MAKE THAT DECISION
THAN JUST DELEGATE IT I THINK THAT THEY THEY HAD A GREAT DEAL OF UM ALL THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS GOT TOGETHER AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD A CONFERENCE AND I MEAN IT WAS JUST IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST STRENGTHENING THINGS FOR OUR FAMILY
GETTING DOWN TOGETHER AND DOING THAT AND AND JUST THE CHILDREN WERE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION BECAUSE IT INVOLVED JUST THEM AND YOU KNOW MAKING THAT DECISION AND THEN
FINDING A PLACE AND EVERYBODY HAD DUTIES TO PERFORM YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW GIVING MONEY OR WHETHER IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKING PART IN IN A LOT OF THE DECISION MAKING YOU KNOW LIKE FINDING A A PROPER NURSING HOME
AND THEY I KNOW THEY AND WELL THEY HAD WELL THEY HAD THEY HAD SEEN IT COMING SO SO I MEAN IT I MEAN I I I I HARDLY I I TRULY WISH THAT IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WERE TO HAPPEN THAT MY CHILDREN WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR ME
YEAH YEAH WELL WE WE YEAH
UHHUH
YEAH
UHHUH
YEAH YEAH WELL WITH MY WITH MY GRANDMOTHER I THINK IT WAS IT WAS SUCH THAT UH THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH
SHE WAS VERY WELL AWARE AND HER DAUGHTER CAME AND VISITED HER AT LEAST HER DAUGHTER CAME AND VISITED HER AND ALSO HER UH SEVERAL GRANDCHILDREN CAME AND VISITED HER EVERYDAY
AND I THINK THAT WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST
UM I I I THINK IT WOULD BE IT WAS MORE OF A RELIEF FOR HER
AND UM I MEAN BUT SHE WAS TRULY SHE WAS TRULY AWARE I MEAN I I DIDN'T I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD HOW I WOULD DEAL IF ONE OF MY PARENTS CAME WITH WITH ALZHEIMER'S OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH IS WHICH IS FAR MORE DEVASTATING
AND UM
I I I THINK THAT WHAT ONE THING THAT WAS THAT THEY WERE REALLY CONCERNED WITH PROBABLY WAS THE FACT
IT WASN'T NECESSARILY YOU KNOW LIKE THE QUANTITY OF CARE BUT THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE WERE VERY
WERE VERY INTERESTED THAT TO MAKE IT AS CLOSE A HOME ENVIRONMENT AS POSSIBLE I I THINK I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW FOR MYSELF I I SEE THAT AS PROBABLY THE THE
WHAT EVERYTHING WOULD HINGE UPON IS IT HOW CLOSE IS IT TO A HOME ENVIRONMENT THAT'S THE THAT'S PROBABLY THE MAJOR QUESTION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S INTERESTING THAT THAT A LOT OF THE POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS CHANGING BECAUSE
YOU KNOW UH NOW THAT SO MANY MORE MINORITIES WHERE THEY HAVE HAD EXTENDED FAMILIES FOR SUCH A LONG TIME
UM IN MATTER OF FACT IN THE UNITED STATES WE USED TO HAVE EXTENDED FAMILIES IT WASN'T BUT I GUESS AS WE BECOME MORE INDUSTRIALIZED AND MORE YOU KNOW LESS IN A RURAL SITUATION
WE WE DON'T WE WE WE CHOOSE NOT TO DEAL WITH THE EXTENDED FAMILY BECAUSE WE FEEL IT'S KIND OF CUMBERSOME WHEN IN REALITY IT MAKES THINGS MUCH MUCH EASIER
UH
YEAH YEAH I I I THINK THAT PERHAPS PERHAPS THE EXTENDED FAMILY
YOU KNOW THAT THAT IT MAY BE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO A LOT OF THINGS EVEN EVEN EVEN CHILD CARE YOU KNOW I MEAN OF COURSE THERE THERE COMES OTHER ISSUES YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT
ANY OF THE GRANDPARENTS WOULD WE FEEL THEY'RE GONNA BE A GOOD THEY'RE GONNA BE A GOOD CARETAKER FOR OUR CHILDREN BUT I MEAN THEY RAISED US AFTER ALL
YEAH BUT UH I'M I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN WE ALWAYS UH I MEAN I'VE I'VE HAD A A LOT OF GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH UH WITH MANY MANY PEOPLE
ESPECIALLY WHERE THEY'VE HAD UH EXTENDED FAMILY AND I AND AND I I KIND OF SEE THAT THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS
YOU KNOW WE MAY NEED TO LIKE GET CLOSE TO THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND AND GET DOWN TO THE VALUES OF YOU KNOW I MEAN UH IT'S
MONEY SEEMS TO BE TOO BIG OF AN ISSUE WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY AND I I THINK I THINK THAT WE MAY NOT YOU KNOW THAT MAY BE
YOU KNOW PERHAPS IF WE PUT MONEY ON THE BACK BURNER THAT MAY THAT MAY CHOOSE TO ALLEVIATE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS I MEAN I MEAN WE MAY NOT WE MAY NOT HAVE AS HIGH A STANDARD OF LIVING BUT
THE QUALITY BUT ACTUALLY HAVE A TRUER STANDARD OF LIVING
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY WELL
OKAY ALL RIGHT HEY BYE BYE
WELL OF COURSE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT ONE OF THE LAST FEW THINGS IN THE WORLD YOU'D EVER WANT TO DO YOU KNOW UNLESS IT'S JUST JUST YOU KNOW REALLY YOU KNOW FOR AND FOR THEIR UH YOU KNOW FOR THEIR OWN GOOD
