SHE HAD A FALL AND UH FINALLY UH SHE HAD UH PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND IT GOT SO MUCH THAT SHE COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF HER HOUSE SHE THEN SHE LIVED IN AN APARTMENT AND UM
THAT WAS EVEN HARDER ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST A CHANGE OF
CHANGE OF LOCATION AND IT WAS VERY DISTURBING FOR HER BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SO USED TO TRAVELING I MEAN SHE TRAVELED SHE HAD SHE HAD CHILDREN ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND YOU KNOW SHE SPENT NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR JUST VISITING HER CHILDREN
